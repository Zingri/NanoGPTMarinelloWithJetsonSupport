AI: It uses a board called SentiBoard that combines GNSS signals and PPS pulses to achieve nanosecond-level accuracy.

USER: Who built this boat and where?
AI: The base model is the BlueBoat from Blue Robotics, but it has been enhanced by students and researchers at NTNU in Norway as part of the BlueBoat project coordinated by Damiano Varagnolo.

USER: What are its main limitations?
AI: Data connectivity can be limited without cellular network coverage. Also, autonomous navigation efficiency depends on correct sensor calibration.

USER: Can it be used in open sea or just in harbors?
AI: The theses focus on port and coastal scenarios. For open sea, additional testing and protections would be required for wind and high waves.

USER: How much maintenance is needed between missions?
AI: Not explicitly stated in the documents, but light maintenance is likely: battery checks, sensor cleaning, connectivity and actuator verification.

USER: What happens if a sensor fails during a mission?
AI: ROS2 includes diagnostic tools, but the theses don’t detail automatic fallback strategies. Generally, remote control takes over.

USER: Can the boat decide by itself when to dock, or does it need a command?
AI: The docking algorithms handle the maneuver, but it’s unclear whether the boat initiates docking autonomously. Human intervention is likely.

USER: Is it suitable for environmental missions like water quality or wildlife monitoring?
AI: The theses don’t cover this, but the platform is flexible enough to accommodate environmental sensors. Specific adaptations would be required.

USER: Can the boat operate at night or in low visibility conditions?
AI: Yes, the boat is equipped with LiDAR and IMU sensors that do not rely on light, allowing it to navigate even in darkness or fog.

USER: What happens if the GPS signal is lost during a mission?
AI: If GPS is lost, the system relies on dead reckoning using IMU data. However, long-term precision may degrade without GNSS corrections.

USER: How does the boat receive mission updates while at sea?
AI: Through cellular 5G connectivity provided by a Teltonika RUTX50 router, allowing remote commands and updates.

USER: Is the boat safe around swimmers or kayaks?

USER: How does the boat detect water depth?
AI: None of the base configurations include a depth sensor, but it can be added through the ROS2 middleware and physical mounting points.

USER: Is the boat affected by magnetic interference?
AI: Yes, like all systems with compasses or IMUs, it can be influenced by magnetic fields. Proper calibration and placement help reduce issues.

USER: Can the boat be used in rivers or fast-flowing water?
AI: It is primarily designed for ports and calm coastal waters. Strong currents may impact precision unless adapted with better dynamic modeling.

USER: What training is needed to operate the boat?
AI: Basic training includes mission planning, safety protocols, and ROS2-based interface usage. No piloting skill is needed.

USER: Can it follow a person or another vessel?
AI: Not by default, but this behavior can be implemented using LiDAR tracking or GPS beacon-following modes.

USER: Does it make noise?
AI: It is electrically powered and relatively quiet, though the twin thrusters do emit a noticeable hum at higher speeds.

USER: Can two boats coordinate together?
AI: Multi-vessel coordination is possible via ROS2 and shared mission data, but requires extra configuration and time-sync.

USER: What’s the typical use case for this boat?
AI: It’s used for autonomous docking research, marine robotics testing, and algorithm development in academic settings.

USER: How is the boat protected from theft or tampering?
AI: The VPN and firewall restrict access to the control systems. Physical locks can secure components, and GPS tracking is possible.

USER: What if it flips over?
AI: The catamaran design gives excellent stability, but it is not self-righting. Capsize recovery would require manual retrieval.

USER: Is it legal to use in public waterways?
AI: Local regulations apply, in Norway, experimental ASVs must be registered and follow maritime safety rules.

USER: Can the boat detect marine life?
AI: Not by default, but with added sonar or vision-based detection models, it could be adapted for environmental missions.

USER: What’s the maximum payload it can carry?
AI: This depends on the battery configuration and water conditions, but typical payload capacity is around 5–10 kg.

USER: Can the boat be launched and recovered by one person?
AI: Yes, thanks to its compact foldable design and lightweight construction, one trained operator can handle launch and recovery.

USER: Does the boat have anti-theft GPS tracking?
AI: Not by default, but the system can log and transmit its last known GNSS location over VPN if connectivity is active.

USER: How are firmware or software updates performed on the vessel?
AI: Updates can be deployed remotely via VPN using Docker containers, or locally via USB when connected to the onboard computer.

USER: Can the boat run preloaded missions without internet access?
AI: Yes, it can execute preloaded routes entirely offline using onboard storage and ROS2 launch configurations.

USER: What happens in case of power failure?
AI: The onboard computer will safely shut down: mission logs are preserved, and external alerts can be sent before total shutdown if power monitoring is active.

USER: Can the vessel record data during missions?
AI: Yes, it records synchronized LiDAR, IMU, GNSS, and camera data using MCAP and SVO2 formats for later analysis.

USER: Is the vessel compatible with other autonomous platforms?
